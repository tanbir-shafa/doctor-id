# Daktar.Link — SEO & Growth Plan (dependency-ordered)

> **Progress tracker:** [../progress/seo-progress.md](../progress/seo-progress.md)
> **Status:** drafted 2026-06-17 — pending approval

## Goal

Three search targets, in order of winnability:

1. **Own every listed doctor's name** — e.g. "Dr. Karim Rahman" / "ডা. করিম রহমান". ~3,200 profiles × spelling variants = tens of thousands of near-zero-competition queries. Fastest, biggest ROI.
2. **Win specialty × location mid-tail** — "cardiologist in Dhaka", "child specialist Chattogram". 3–6 months.
3. **Reach the head terms** — "doctor in bangladesh", "specialist doctor", "doctor dhaka". 9–18 months; only achievable once authority + links + content exist.

Two multipliers across all three:
- **Bangla** — English-only leaves most BD search volume on the table (`next-intl` scaffolding already exists).
- **Distribution loop** — every shared `/[slug]` (Rx pad, WhatsApp bio, business card) → branded search + backlinks no competitor can buy.

Positioning: the public surface stays **patient-first** ("the verified, authentic doctor directory of Bangladesh"); the doctor-network / EMR angle is a **B2D growth layer**, not a public SEO surface (the single `/for-doctors` page excepted).

## The 5 pillars (+ measurement)

- **Names** — entity SEO on every profile (unique copy, schema, Bangla `alternateName`, reviews)
- **Geo** — programmatic specialty×district done right (no thin pages, unique hubs, district hubs)
- **Trust** — E-E-A-T / YMYL (trust pages, Organization schema, verification as the brand)
- **Bangla** — bilingual money pages + `hreflang`
- **Off-page** — distribution loop, embeds, digital PR, partnerships
- **Measure** — cross-cutting instrumentation that frames everything

## How to read this plan

Tasks are grouped into **stages by dependency**: a stage consumes only the outputs of earlier stages. Within a stage, tasks run in **parallel**. `Dep:` lists the task numbers that must finish first (`—` = none). Departments: **ENG** (engineering), **PRD** (product/design), **CON** (content/editorial), **MKT** (marketing/growth), **LEG** (legal/compliance), **ANA** (analytics/data).

## Build sequence (dependency-ordered)

### Stage 0 — Instrumentation & long-pole kickoff (Day 1, no deps)

Measurement must exist *before* we change anything (we need a baseline). Legal drafts, Content templates, and Product specs are long poles that gate later builds, so they start on Day 1 even though their dependent builds land in Stages 2–3.

1. **[ANA]** Google Search Console + Bing Webmaster verified; sitemap submitted. _Dep: —_
2. **[ENG]** Install GA4 + define conversion events (claim, OTP-start). _Dep: —_
3. **[ANA]** Configure GA4 + organic→claim funnel. _Dep: 2_
4. **[ANA]** Rank-tracking baseline for 3 keyword baskets (doctor names sample, specialty×district, head terms). _Dep: —_
5. **[ANA]** Source Bangla name data + specialty/district glossary. _Dep: —_
6. **[LEG]** Draft `/privacy` policy (data handling, selfie/Gov-ID, retention). _Dep: —_

## Critical path

The longest dependency chain is the **authority chain**:

> **9** (claim wording) → **30** (trust copy) → **38** (trust pages) → **47** (cornerstone articles) → **49** (digital PR)

Start task 9 and all Content/Legal drafting on **Day 1** — it gates the deepest chain. The next-longest poles, also Day-1 starts:

- **Bilingual:** 5 (Bangla data) → 35 (translate) → 43 (wire `hreflang`)
- **Geo:** 12 (design) → 31/33 (hub + intent copy) → 39/41 (build hubs/intent pages)
- **Reviews:** 16 (UX) + 11 (policy) → 44 (build)

Stage 1 (pure-code wins 19–24) has **no external dependency** and should ship immediately in parallel — don't wait on Stage 0.

## KPIs / acceptance

- % of listed doctors ranking #1 for their own name (target: majority by month 3)
- Zero thin / soft-404 specialty×district pages in GSC coverage
- Non-branded organic clicks by template (profiles, specialty×district, district hubs)
- Organic → claim conversion rate
- Branded search volume ("daktar link") trend
- Bangla-query impressions once Stage 3 + bilingual land

## Changelog

- **2026-06-17** — Plan drafted from the 5-pillar SEO strategy; 54 tasks ordered by dependency into 6 stages.
